                        <p>"Own Goal" and "Nautilus's Conundrum" are two unique game design projects aimed at creating engaging and introspective gaming experiences. These projects were part of my Designing Playful Experiences course at UM, where I was responsible for all aspects of design and development. "Own Goal" challenges players to control a 'goal' and prevent the ball from passing them, while "Nautilus's Conundrum" involves a canine astronaut navigating an interstellar maze using head movements detected by a webcam.</p>

                        <p>The UX process began with identifying the problem of creating games that communicate meaningful messages while being engaging. The target audience was gamers interested in thoughtful and unique experiences. The ideation process involved iterative design and development, starting with concept creation, followed by prototyping, testing, and refinement. GameSalad was used for development, and playtesting provided valuable feedback for iterative improvements.</p>

                        <p>The final products were functional game prototypes accompanied by project documentation and a case study report. Throughout the development, challenges such as refining gameplay mechanics and ensuring intuitive controls were addressed. These projects provided valuable insights into game design and development, highlighting the importance of iterative testing and user feedback in creating engaging gaming experiences.</p>
