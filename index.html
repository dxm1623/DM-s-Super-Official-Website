                        This is my website, coded in conjunction with my studies at the University of Miami as part of both my Front End Fundamentals and Studio/Portfolio courses.
                        <br><br>
                        I am diving head first into the world of game design and development, on a mission to communicate engaging and deeply introspective messages through the ever enthralling medium of gaming. Beyond that, I have an affinity for graphic design and web design, and always willing to learn in any field I approach.
                        <br><br>
                        This website is a work in progress, to be completed never. It shall be updated as I build my repertoire.
                        <br><br>
                        Please, feel free to look around!

                                <p>These were my second and third projects for my Designing Playful Experiences course at UM, which were designed and coded in GameSalad. These functional prototypes are among some of my first forays into game design and development.

                                <strong>Own Goal</strong> is a game where the player controls a 'goal' and is tasked with making sure the ball does not go past them.

                                <strong>Nautilus's Conundrum</strong> is a game where the player is a canine astronaut traversing an interstellar maze using only their head and a webcam.
